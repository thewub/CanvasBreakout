# CanvasBreakout

Just a quick exercise to teach myself HTML `<canvas>` and game development.

## Todo

- [ ] Refactor code into classes
- [ ] Powerups
- [ ] Multiple hit blocks?
- [ ] Add more levels (and cheat mode for skipping?)
- [ ] Menu

[Breaking Down Breakout: System And Level Design For Breakout-style Games](http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/1630/breaking_down_breakout_system_and_.php) has some interesting info for future development.
